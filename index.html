    <title>Tales from the Scrum Bowl - Servant-Leadership in the Dual Role of Scrum Master and Developer</title>

    <meta name="description" content="What's it like to be a developer on a team *and* to serve as its Scrum Master? For many organizations, Scrum and Scaled Agile Framework are great strategies to help developers adapt to changing environments and focus on delive> ring valuable results. The Scrum Master’s role is to play servant-leader for the team; to help them get answers, or get unblocked, and to be accountable to themselves so that they can be accountable to the business. But what does it mean to wear both the developer and Scrum Master hats? Does being a Scrum Master take away from the development role? Which role takes priority? Do the roles compliment each other? And what can we learn from each experience? This talk focuses on doing just that — playing both roles, what it means for the team, for the business, and your career.">

            * this one from Ross
            * esp. at beginning of Agile at DDC...
            * ...almost every SM was a former TPM
            * and whereas a TPM could manage multiple projects
              (and thus across multiple teams)
            * being a SM is more intense (b/c you're embedded in the team)
            * so by taking that bold 1st step: demonstrated to more teams that it could be done
            * ...to take SM'ing seriously
            * ...and that you (yes, YOU) Mr. or Ms. Developer, could do it
            * (i.e., more _capable_ SMs)
            * EXAMPLE: at least 5 other technical people became SMs

            * "Don't get me wrong..."
            * TPMs have made careers of doing _exactly this_
              & I've got the utmost respect for what they do
            * and/but/so: in some fast-paced situations, having the SM _be_ technical is an advantage
              * e.g., you already have the code checked out
              * and/or you have the trust of the team
              * ...and so when you are over with another team trying to unblock
              * ...you can just make a call about what to do
                (b/c you have some technical insight and you have the team's trust)
            * EXAMPLE: somewhat frequently, we would escalate to SE
              and I'd be able to _just tell them what they needed_

          <h2>Has a Trusted Advocate</h2>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            * 2 slides ago I was defending TPMs
            * but let's admit it:
              * even on the most healthy teams there's some friction b/w devs + PMs
            * DDC did away w/ (T)PMs in favor of SMs when we "went Agile"
            * but SM still fills a lot of the roles that TPMs historically did
              * like creating the "artifacts"
              * like coordinating w/ other teams ("unblocking")
              * like being the one that gets called into this or that meeting
            * and/but/so there's that historical friction w/ even the best TPM
              * but when your SM is also a dev, it's a different relationship
                (b/w the SM and the team)
            * EXAMPLE: when representing them at meetings...
              * ...they know that I'm able to (say...) defend the estimates

          <h2>Learning Leadership</h2>

            * so many leaders...
              * Managers & Directors...

              * Product Owners
              * &c.
            * but SM is a leader for _learning_
            * SM is there not to push the team
              * ...but to coach the team into high-performance
            * you get to high-performance by...
              * trying and failing
              * failing and learning
            * EXAMPLE: estimates!
              * something we learned pretty early on in our Agile journey
              * beginning: fine-grained tasks - "That should cover everything!"
              * except: it never does (something is always missed)
              * TO THE RETRO! part over-thinking; part sand-bagging?
              * try it: _resist_ the urge to spell it out
                * use higher-level tasks
                * seemingly larger estimates

            * as a dev = wind up task focused
              * and/or project focused

              * the point = not thinking at the level of "the business"

          <h2>More Confidence</h2>

            * came directly out of looking at the business holistically

              * ...I felt more confident that I was working on THE RIGHT THINGS
            * felt MORE AWARE of priorities
            * had an EASIER TIME of separating the important from the urgent
            * _started_ to master "The Art of the Positive No"
              * (I'm still not _great_ at this, but I've gotten pretty good)
              * e.g., listening, ack'ing, and explaining Why-Nots and Alternatives
            * _some of that_ comes from the VISIBILITY that is one of the central tenets of Scrum
              * SEEING the backlog on the wall every day
              * SEEING the stories we're actively working on

            * SPOILER ALERT: after about 9 months...
              ...I got out of the SM game
              * got out of it what I wanted
              * felt it was time to return my focus to dev
            * but: good career move
              * new perspective on the business
                * but it's that... "meta-learning"
                * about how to relate _to_ the business
                  (and what it needs)
              * a good _kind_ of leadership role to have
