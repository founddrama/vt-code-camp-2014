# Tales from the Scrum Bowl

### Servant-Leadership in the Dual Role of Scrum Master and Developer

Abstract:

> What's it like to be a developer on a team *and* to serve as its Scrum Master? In
> this talk, we'll discuss life on an agile scrum team and what it means to wear 
> both of these hats. Does being a Scrum Master take away from the development 
> role? Which role takes priority? Do the roles compliment each other? And what can 
> we learn from each experience?
